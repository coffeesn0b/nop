# Nop

## What is Nop?

Nop is an extensible "NoOps" tool that will generate a full stack (and opinionated) large scale cloud native application with example business logic, automated tests, infrastructure, and CI/CD, using a series of prompts or flags. Nop picks up where other SRE tools leave off... by going beyond just infrastructure concerns, and providing developers a fully generated application architecture, environments, monitoring, pipeline, etc.

This architecture will be secure, SOC and HIPAA compliant, as well as choosing technology that is most appropriate for the described problem. It will also generate a ReadMe where it documents all the appropriate tools that it generates for your service. We don't believe there's a tradeoff between standardization and customization when it's approached correctly.
